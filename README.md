The repository of the course "Programming 1" at UNI Graz.

Course adapted from: https://github.com/gvasold/gdp21 by Gunter Vasold.
All notebooks are in English.
## Usage

To use the notebooks make sure you have installed:
* Python version 3. 
* Jupyter. Install it via pip or conda (`pip install --user jupyter` or `conda install jupyter` if you use Conda/Anaconda)
* I suggest to also install jupyterlab, which is a more modern version of `jupyter notebook` (which was installed automatically with `jupyter`): 
  `pip install --user jupyterlab` or `conda install jupyterlab`.

Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucijakrusic/IP23.git
```

Then change into `IP23` directory and start the Jupyter server:

```bash
cd IP23
```

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

or, if you have installed jupyterlab:

```bash
jupyter-lab
```

This will bring up your browser and will show you the contents of the `IP23` directory.
